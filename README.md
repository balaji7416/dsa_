# DSA Learning Repository

This repository contains **Data Structures & Algorithms concepts** that I have learned and implemented from scratch.

## Purpose

- Build strong fundamentals in DSA
- Understand _why_ an approach works, not just memorize solutions
- Maintain well-structured reference code for revision

## opics Covered so far

# basics:

- Stack
- Queue
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Hash Map (in progress...)

## Structure

Each folder represents a concept and contains:

- Explanation (via comments)
- Sample implementations

## Language

- C++ (primary)

## Progress

Learning Hashmaps

> Learning DSA for problem-solving, interviews, and real-world backend systems.
